## Making backups

## Starting up with KVM
Using KVM via the command line requires a little bit more setup than I am used to.  As with other facets of 

To install the guest virtual machine, I opted to go with virt-install rather than the virt manager, or 

	sudo apt-get virtinst

	sudo mount -t iso9660 /dev/dvd /media/cdrom/

	sudo dd if=/dev/dvd of=dvd.iso

	
this one:

sudo virt-install --connect qemu:///system -n vivid_template -r 6144 --vcpus=2 --disk path=/disk2/kvm/images/vividTemplate.img,size=400 --location=/media/cdrom --graphics none --os-type linux --description "Template Ubuntu Vivid Guest" --network=bridge:virbr0 --extra-args='console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 serial'

Didn't work due to X11 issues!

Had issues with SSH, had to enable following in server sshd_config

	X11UseLocalHost no

And also had to make sure that following was uncommented in my local ssh

	ForwardX11Trusted yes
