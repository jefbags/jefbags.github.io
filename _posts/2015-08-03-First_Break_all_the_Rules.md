## What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently!
I want to capture some notes and interesting concepts I've learned from reading the book "First, Break All the Rules" by Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman (Copyright © 1999 by the Gallup Organization).
<img align="left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/post3/pic1.png">
The book represents over twenty five years of research conducted by the Gallup Organization.  They interviewed millions of employees and managers in order to find out what makes the most successful manager. They asked each of them hundreds of different questions, on every conceivable aspect of the workplace, job duties, workplace satisfaction, management style etc.  They also collected metrics and other performance data on a cross section of twelve distinct industries, analyzing scores of things such as productivity, profitability, employee retention, and customer satisfaction. 
They then took all of this survey and data, overlayed some statistical and analytical methodology, and boiled down managerial success to twelve basic questions.  These then can be further divided into 3 basic sections of employee and team maturity.

So what are the magic questions?  Here's what they came up with...

## The Questions

According to the authors, according to the statistical analysis they conducted on the data they collected, patterns in the effectiveness of certain managers emerged.  Managers who were able to help facilitate answers to the following questions for their employees were more likely to have successful, productive and happy teams.  The questions, in no particular order are:

* In the last six months, has someone at work talked to me about my progress?
* At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?
* Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person?
* This last year, have I had opportunities at work to learn and grow?
* In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for doing good work?
* Does the mission/purpose of my company make me feel my job is important?
* Is there someone at work who encourages my development?
* Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?
* Do I have a best friend at work?
* At work, do my opinions seem to count?
* Do I know what is expected of me at work?
* Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?

## The Hierarchy

Here's the thing:  The questions are not random though, and need to be answered correctly in an approximate order.  Actually, according to the authors, you as a manager can't facilitate the successful answering *unless* the lower questions have been completed.  There's a dependency.  They break the questions up into sections, almost like a Maslowian hierarchy that looks something like the following.

So what happens at each level?  According to the authors, the levels and questions are broken up in the followings basic ways.

### Level 1 - “Base Camp”, aka What do I get?

This is the most fundamental level where employees come to understand what is expected of them, expect feedback and expect to be given the direction they need to do their work everyday.   The questions that need to be answered are:

1. Do I know what is expected of me at work?
2. Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?

### Level 2 - “Camp 1“, aka What do I give?
The ascension to Camp 1 is a shift in maturity from inward to outward where there is a desire to develop independently, contribute more pro-actively and optimize performance.  Questions include:

3. At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?
4. In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for doing good work?
5. Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person?
6. Is there someone at work who encourages my development?

### Level 3 - “Camp 2“, aka Do I belong here?
At Camp 2, the focus shifts from day-to-day performance towards personal and group integration.  The questions below get at how well in-tune:

7. At work, do my opinions seem to count?
8. Does the mission/purpose of my company make me feel my job is important?
9. Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?
10. Do I have a best friend at work?
11. In the last six months, has someone at work talked to me about my progress?
12. This last year, have I had opportunities at work to learn and grow?

### The Summit
An excerpt from the book:

> If you can answer positively to all of these twelve questions, then you have reached the summit. Your focus is clear.You feel a recurring sense of achievement, as though the best of you is being called upon and the best  of you responds every single day. You look around and see others who also seem to thrill to the challenge of their work. Buoyed by your mutual understanding and your shared purpose, you climbers look out and forward to the challenges marching over the horizon. It is not easy to remain at the summit for long, with the ground shifting beneath your feet and the strong winds buffeting you this way and that. But while you are there, it is quite a feeling.


## Conclusion
It’s easy to think there’s a silver bullet.
Fulfilling each question can pull a manager in different directions.

The authors got out of their way to point out that most companies tend to focus on the top level, without adequately satisfying the lower levels.

> Inexperienced climbers might suggest that if you have lots of money and not much time, you could helicopter into Camp 3 and race to the summit. Experienced guides know that you would never make it. Mountain sickness would sap your energy and slow your progress to a crawl. These guides will tell you that to reach the summit you have to pay your dues. During your ascent you have to spend a great deal of time between Base Camp and Camp 1. The more time you spend at these lower reaches, the more stamina you will have in the thin air near the summit.

It almost sounds obvious. But over the last fifteen years most man agers have been encouraged to focus much higher up the mountain. Mission statements, diversity training, self-directed work teams—all try to help employees feel they belong (Camp 2). Total quality management, re-engineering, continuous improvement, learning organizations—all address the need for employees to innovate, to challenge cozy assumptions and rebuild them a fresh, every day (Camp 3). All of these initiatives were very well conceived. Many of them were well executed. But almost all of them have withered.
