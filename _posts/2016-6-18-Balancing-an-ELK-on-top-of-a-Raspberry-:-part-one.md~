## Adding Intrusion Detection to OpenWRT with Raspberry Pi and ELK

![pic]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/post7/pic2.jpg)

The goal of this projects is to install intrusion detection monitoring and alerting on a home lab network.  The following components will be installed and configured:

1. Set up and configure Raspbian on Raspberry Pi
2. Install and configure Suricata for Intrusion Detection
3. Utilize Elastic, Logstash and Kibana for monitoring and log management

Let's Begin!

### The archiecture

The purpose of this project will be to set up an intrusion detection system to monitor home traffic, and specifically traffic moving between the 3 zones previously configured in the router: internal, DMZ and external.  The primary goal will to watch out for anomalies, and specfic traffic patterns we would not like to see.  

I wanted to set up intrusion detection in a low cost way, but I didn't want to do any extra processing on the OpenWRT router itself.  That's what has made using Raspberry Pi a really great solution.  It's small, lightweight, versatile, low-power etc.  

Ideally, I would have set up the Raspberry Pi inline between the external and other networks.  This would have allowed for true intrusion prevention capabilities.  To do this with a Raspberry, extra work would have been required because it only has one ethernet interface.  Either a second USB NIC adapter would have been needed, or sub-intefaces and vlan's would have been the solution.  Out of those two, I like the second better, but I don't have an extra managed switch at the moment, and quite frankly I was too lazy to do all this now.  I will come back to later.  For the moment, setting up the detection will be the goal.

### Setting up Raspberry Pi

This was really a non-event.  The Raspberry Pi device was extremely easy to set up and use.  The Raspberry Pi website has a ton of information on getting started with these cool little machines.  Check it out at [https://www.raspberrypi.org/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).  The device was hardened somewhat similar as described in previous posts, and also postfix was installed for email.  




### Installing Suricata
This was really easy too!  

	apt-get install suricata

So... that's it.  Just worked.  


### Bro issues - 

Mine crashed

needed to fix by doing the following

	cd /opt/nsm/bro/bin
	sudo broctl install
	sudo broctl restart

	sudo broctl status 





## Conclusion
The Raspberry Pi is a damn cool computing device!  Set up like a dream, so no drama in this post.  Next time, we'll focus on ELK and getting that going.
